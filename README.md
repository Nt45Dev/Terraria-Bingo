Welcome to Terraria Bingo! The rules are fairly simple and the card is customizable.
Objectives are generated in a table and your settings will determine what is pulled
from the table at what frequency. The table will be referred to as the pool.

Start by deciding which world evil you want, and if you will be playing in multiplayer.
The world evil will make sure you do not have any biome-exlusive enemies/bosses/items
which you can not (easily) get in a normal playthrough.

For progression, check either pre-hardmode, hardmode, or both. This will determine
which objectives the game gives you. Selecting hardmode will increase the difficulty of
the pre-hardmode task pool slightly.
For example, easy difficulty with only hardmode selected may have some medium or
hard pre-hardmode tasks.

For the class selection, leave all boxes blank to have all class items and challenges 
available in the pool. If you want to only play certain classes, check the classes you 
want to have enabled.
